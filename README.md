# Triangle-area-comparison-LAB
(classes)

Given class Triangle, complete the program to read and set the base and height of triangle1 and triangle2, determine which triangle's area is larger, and output the larger triangle's info, making use of Triangle's relevant methods.

Ex: If the input is:

3.0
4.0
4.0
5.0

where 3.0 is triangle1's base, 4.0 is triangle1's height, 4.0 is triangle2's base, and 5.0 is triangle2's height, 

the output is:

Triangle with larger area:
Base: 4.00
Height: 5.00
Area: 10.00
